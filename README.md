# Climathon

A Climathon is a hackathon, or a swarm lab, directed at addressing local and immediate problems surrounding climate change. This GitHub repo is designed to be a repository for the Karlsruhe Climathon, which will serve as a central archive for projects from the event.

Currently, this repository is being used to host a static web site from organizing purposes.

It is my hope to see the site become a model for other similar events.
